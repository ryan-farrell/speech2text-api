## Setup

- You'll need to create a local db with the name speech2text-api and setup your db user to have access to this new db

- Copy and paste the .env.example file and rename to just .env.
- In your new .env you will need to add the required db username to line 14 and db password to line 15 instead of the place holders.

- You will need to drop a copy of your google-credentials.json and rename to setup.json. Place this in the setup-files directory. setup-files dir is in the root dir of the application.
